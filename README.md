# WhyBills

WhyBills is a system designed to eliminate printed bills at any point of sale. Instead of giving printed bills at POS stations, retailers can now encode their bill & generate a QR Code from the resulting string value on our [POS System](https://github.com/SuyashLakhotia/WhyBillsPOS) and display this QR Code to the customer. The customer can then scan this QR Code with the WhyBills Android app, which will decode & store the data. This data is then displayed to the customer in a human-readable format on the app. In addition to storing the bills, the app also acts as an expense manager, giving the user access to all of his stored expenses as well as displaying the total amount spent in the current month.
