# WhyBills
Created for and during the Facebook Singapore Hackathon 2015.

WhyBills is an Android application designed to eliminate printed bills. Instead of getting printed bills at POS Stations, retailers can now encode their bill with our algorithm & generate a QR Code from the resulting string value. They can then display this QR Code to the customer, who will have our application on their smartphone. Our application will then scan, decode & store the data. In addition to storing the bills, the application also acts as an expense manager, giving the total amount spent in the current month and giving the user access to his various expenses.
